# javascript-challenge
Demonstrate js programming skills by tracking alien sitings, enabling buttons to filter the data, and working with a large dataset.

In this challenge, I use the UFO dataset provided in the form of an array of JavaScript objects and build a table that reflects the UFO sightings based on user input of date.

This is the entry screen on page load:
![](/UFO-level-1/screenshots/onpageload.png)

The user can enter a date in the indicated box.  NOTE that valid data is currently 1/1/2010 thru 1/13/2010.
![](/UFO-level-1/screenshots/enterdata.png)

When the Filter Table button is pressed, the table will load with the relevant data:
![](/UFO-level-1/screenshots/filtereddata.png)

For the bonus, the code was converted into separate functions for:
    - creating and building an array of filter input
    - applying the filter to the dataset
    - building the html table.
The user can select how to filter the dataset based on date, city, state, country or UFO shape, or any combination thereof.
The filter screen appears as follows:
![](/UFO-level-2/screenshots/multiplefilter.png)
