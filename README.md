# javascript-challenge
Demonstrate js programming skills by tracking alien sitings, enabling buttons to filter the data, and working with a large dataset.

In this challenge, I use the UFO dataset provided in the form of an array of JavaScript objects and build a table that reflects the UFO sightings based on user input of date.

This is the entry screen on page load:

The user can enter a date in the indicated box.  NOTE that valid data is currently 1/1/2010 thru 1/13/2010.

When the Filter Table button is pressed, the table will load with the relevant data:
